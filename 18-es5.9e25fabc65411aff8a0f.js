Different potential solutions to a given problem, referred to as genomes, are initially randomly generated by the algorithm. These genomes are stored in a list of fixed size known as the population. The algorithm progresses by alternating between evolutionary and evaluation stages. At each evaluation stage, every genome in the population is tested against a fitness function and given a score which corresponds to how effectively they have solved the problem. The fitness functions in my implementation are customized per-model, but all functions are built upon giving a high reward for the longest distance travelled. The evolutionary stage typically involves a combination of crossover and mutation. Crossover is a process in which two genomes, now known as the parents, are selected from the population and their information is combined to produce some number of children. Mutation takes in a single genome sequence and slightly changes some of its values, creating a slightly different solution to the problem. Crossover and mutations are performed on the population in an effort to produce better solutions that can be used in later generations. At the end of each evolutionary stage, the population, which may contain extra genome data from crossover, must be culled back to its original size.
